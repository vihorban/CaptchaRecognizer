C# WPF projects. Several applications that allow user to recognize some types of CAPTCHA.
AnalyzerData is a special application that allows user to change learning information. User can choose initial file and number of files to display. Then he can manually set some information to learn.
Captcha1 is an application that allows user to recognize first type of CAPTCHA(from C:\captcha\examples1\). User can choose file path. He will receive the recognized text of CAPTCHA as a result.
Captcha2 is an application that allows user to recognize second type of CAPTCHA(from C:\captcha\examples2\). Functions are similar to previous application. The application doesn't work properly at the moment.
